Dev Link is a full-stack web-app which allows developers to create a profile, showcase their abilities and quickly search & filter for other developers.

I built this project using the MERN stack and especially enjoyed using modern React with Redux and Reselect to efficiently manage global state.

It was also extremely satisfying to successfully create a large, secure RESTful API to query for required data from MongoDB.
