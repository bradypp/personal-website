Dev Link is a full-stack web-app which allows developers to create a profile, showcase their abilities and quickly search & filter for other developers.

I planned and built this web-app using the MERN stack and especially enjoyed using modern React with Redux and Reselect to efficiently manage global state.

It was also extremely satisfying to create a large, secure RESTful Express API to query for required data from a MongoDB database and AWS S3.
