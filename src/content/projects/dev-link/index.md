Dev Link is a full-stack web-app which allows developers to create a profile, showcase their abilities and quickly find other developers that fit certain requirements.

In the creation of this project, I became comfortable with planning and developing a large secure web-app using the [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack).
