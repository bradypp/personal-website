A lightning fast and stylish modern website that would be perfect for a digital agency to showcase their work and experience.

<!-- fast, stylish -->

Since it's built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), an optimized version of each page is generated server side and with most data already queried from [Prismic](https://prismic.io) for before any user request.

I enjoyed using the popular CSS framework, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), for most of the styling along with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for the more advanced animations.

<!--
Each page is loaded instantly since most data is queried for and all HTML & CSS generated server side before any user request. . I became comfortable using GraphQL in this project which I used to query the Prismic.io headless CMS for most of the site content. -->
