A lightning fast and stylish modern website that would be perfect for any digital agency to showcase their work and experience.

Since it's built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), an optimized version of each page is generated server side and with most data already queried from [Prismic](https://prismic.io) for before any user request.

I enjoyed using the popular CSS framework, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), for most of the styling along with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for the more advanced animations.
