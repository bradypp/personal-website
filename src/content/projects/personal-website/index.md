My personal site was built using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), the modern react SSR framework.

I took advantage of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and the many Gatsby plugins to thoroughly optimize the site and easily query data from different data sources.

The implemented dark mode involves injecting a script before loading the content to detect user theme preferences then updating the relevant CSS variables.
