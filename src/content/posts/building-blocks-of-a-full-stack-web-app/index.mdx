As a beginner developer, it can be hard to figure out what you need to learn and how to fit it all together to produce a complete, polished product.

What exactly is a RESTful API and how does it relate to the frontend? What languages and frameworks should I be using?

These are the types of questions I'll be answering down below.

## What is a full stack web-app?

<!-- What is a full stack web app -->

Put simply, a full stack web-app is an application built with both a frontend (client side) and a backend (server side).

<!-- TODO: examples: twitter, amazon, shopify -->

The frontend is the visible layer of the application which the user interacts with in the browser. It's responsible for how your user experiences your app so it's important that the frontend runs smoothly and works as expected.

The backend refers to the server side of the application that can't be accessed by the user. It's responsible for any complex logic, making queries for data from a database or external API and securely dealing with sensitive information (such as emails and passwords) away from the view of the user.

The frontend and backend will frequently communicate with each other as the user navigates the app. For example, an E-Commerce store might ask the backend for a list of products and all relevant information such as prices and reviews etc. The backend would then query the database, get and manipulate the data into the required format and send it to the frontend. The frontend would then generate the UI using that data and present it to the user.

## Backend

The backend is the foundations that the rest of the app is built on.

There are 4 main components to the backend:

<CustomList
    items={[
        <span>
            <strong>Server</strong> - The backend is stored and ran on a server which provides the
            storage space, processing power, security and other web services that the backend needs.
        </span>,
        <span>
            <strong>Language/Framework</strong> - Every backend is obviously written using a
            programming language and makes use of a framework which makes development much easier.
        </span>,
        <span>
            <strong>API Routes</strong> - The API is how the frontend interacts with the backend.
            The frontend sends requests through routes (endpoints) to the backend which takes the
            request and returns any required data.
        </span>,
        <span>
            <strong>Database</strong> - The database is the brains of any full stack web-app. It
            takes queries and fetches any data needed by the frontend. E.g. checking the username
            and password provided matches the pair in the database.
        </span>,
    ]}
/>

Although you can build the frontend and backend in any order (or at the same time), I think it makes sense to start building out the backend first. It's much easier to develop the frontend when you've already planned out what data you're going to need and how you're going to access that data.

### Languages & Frameworks

Since the backend runs on a server (instead of in the browser), it can be built using a variety of languages and frameworks.

Some of the most popular choices right now:

#### JavaScript & Node.js

JavaScript can be used for both frontend and backend thanks to Node.js which makes it possible to run JavaScript code outside the browser.

Node.js is increasingly a very popular choice for the backend, especially for frontend devs who are already experienced with JavaScript. It's extremely well supported, is easy to learn and use, has many useful NPM packages and allows you to make a full stack web-app in the same development environment.

#### PHP & Laravel

PHP is a server-side scripting language that was designed specifically for developing web-apps.

Laravel is a PHP framework which makes development much easier through many built in features. These include a modular packaging system, a complete authentication system, automatic testing and more.

#### C# & ASP.NET

C# is a simple and modern strongly typed object oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.

When used together with the ASP.NET Core framework, you're able to build dynamic and secure web-apps with a complex and organized backend. It also has the NuGet package system which is easy to use and is full of useful packages.
