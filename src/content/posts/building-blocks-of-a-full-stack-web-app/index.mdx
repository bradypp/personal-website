As a beginner developer, it can be hard to figure out what you need to learn and how to fit it all together to produce a complete, polished product.

What exactly is a RESTful API and how does it relate to the frontend? What languages and frameworks should I be using?

These are the types of questions I'll be answering down below.

## What is a full stack web-app?

Put simply, a full stack web-app is an application built with both a frontend (client side) and a backend (server side).

The frontend is the visible layer of the application which the user interacts with in the browser. It's responsible for how your user experiences your app so it's important that the frontend runs smoothly and works as expected.

The backend refers to the server side of the application that can't be accessed by the user. It's responsible for any complex logic, making queries for data from a database or external API and securely dealing with sensitive information (such as emails and passwords) away from view.

In a web-app, the frontend and backend or will usually communicate with each other constantly. For example, the frontend of an E-Commerce store might ask the backend for a list of products and all relevant information such as prices and reviews etc. The backend would then query the database for this data and send it to the frontend which will then use this data to generate the UI.

## Backend

The backend is the foundations that the rest of the app is built on.

<!-- TODO: what are the components of a backend -->

Although you can build the frontend and backend in any order (or at the same time), I think it makes sense to start building out the backend first. It's much easier to develop the frontend when you've already planned out what data you will require and how you're going to access that data.

### Languages & Frameworks

Since the backend runs on a server (instead of in the browser), it can be built using a variety of languages and frameworks.

Some of the most popular choices today:

<CustomList
    items={[
        "JavaScript & Node.js - JavaScript can be used for both frontend and backend thanks to Node.js which makes it possible to run JavaScript code outside the browser. Node.js is a very popular choice for the backend because it's extremely well supported, has many useful NPM packages and allows you to make a full stack web-app in the same development environment.",
        'PHP & Laravel - PHP is a server-side scripting language that was designed specifically for developing web-apps. Laravel is a PHP framework which makes development much easier through many built in features. These include a modular packaging system, a complete authentication system, automatic testing and more.',
        'C# & ASP.NET - C# is a strongly typed object oriented programming language and using the ASP.NET framework is a fantastic choice for web-apps which require a more complex and organized backend. ASP.NET also has an easy to use package system called NuGet which is similar to the Node.js NPM package system.',
        "Python & Django - One of the most popular languages due to it's simplicity and efficiency, Python is another great choice for backend development. This is especially true when used with Django which is well supported, versatile, scalable and secure out of the box.",
    ]}
/>

You can also use Go, Java, Ruby and C++.
